# 🔢 Simple Step Counter (JavaScript)
This is a basic Increase/Decrease counter built with Vanilla JavaScript. It is designed to change a label value between 0 and 10.

# ✨ Features
Increment: Increases the value by 1 (up to a maximum of 10).

Decrement: Decreases the value by 1 (down to a minimum of 0).

Easy Logic: Simple if-else conditions to handle the range limits.

🛠 How it Works (Logic)
The project uses basic JavaScript functions to update the text on the screen:

To Increase: Checks if the number is less than 10, then adds 1.

To Decrease: Checks if the number is more than 0, then subtracts 1.
